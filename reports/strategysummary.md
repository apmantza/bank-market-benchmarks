2. **Nordic Efficiency**: Northern European banks maintain the highest average yields (8%+), often characterized by extremely high payout ratios (sometimes exceeding 100% of annual net income via specials).
3. **CEE Dividend Focus**: Regional champions in CEE (Banca Transilvania, NLB) remain pure dividend plays, with almost zero buyback activity, reflecting a preference for direct yield.
